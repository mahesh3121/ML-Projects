# ML-Projects
Introduction
This project aims to provide predictive models for two distinct tasks: predicting house selling prices and classifying churn prediction. The predictive models are implemented using linear regression for house prices, and logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest algorithms for churn prediction. Additionally, the project includes population clustering using the k-means algorithm.

Features
House Price Prediction:

Linear regression model to predict house selling prices based on various features.
Churn Prediction:

Decision tree model for churn prediction.
Random forest model for churn prediction.



Population Clustering:
K-means clustering algorithm to cluster populations based on certain features.
